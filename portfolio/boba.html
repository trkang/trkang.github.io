          <b>Explanation</b> 

          
          <br><br><b>S-tier: Sharetea</b> really depends on the location and who is making your 
          drinks. If its the  dream team then its by far some of the best boba I have 
          had. If the allstars aren't working then it's like a high B-tier. Same goes for 
          <b>Tastea</b>, except the highs are lower but the lows are higher. 
          <b>Drink recommendations:</b> Sharetea: Black Milk Tea with boba and ice-cream 
          (can skimp on the ice-cream but I would try it once) if the allstars are working.
          If not, then Green Milk Tea with Lychee Jelly is always a solid choice and is my 
          favorite drink at the moment. (can get Green Tea if you don't like fruity toppings 
          in your milk teas) Tastea: Their Strawberry Milk Tea is my favorite, go to drink.
          Otherwise, their Peach Me Sweet Tea is very popular and everyone loves it, but I think
          its okay; try it once for yourself.

          <br><br><b>A-tier: Omomo</b> would be S-tier if not for the 40+ minute waits, at all times of day.
          If there is an Omomo near you that has a short wait, with similar quality drinks, it'd probably be 
          my go to boba store. But just know, they are more known for their special drinks not their boba. 
          (Basically, I rarely get boba with my drinks here anymore) I used to dislike <b>Cha for Tea</b> 2 years ago, 
          but they have really improved their drink quality moving them from a low C, high D-tier to A-tier. Also if 
          you're in Irvine, and have the Retail Therapy App, they usually have a buy a drink and popcorn chicken, get one free. 
          (Its comes out to be like $10 cash for 2 popcorn chickens and 2 drinks; it's a steal) <b>Roasting Water</b> is just good
          and rarely ever disappoints. Honestly not too sure about <b>Boba Guys</b> yet, as i've only been 
          there twice but it was good. I also bought their book, I don't know why, but it has some aesthetic boba shots.

          <br><br><b> B-tier: 
          Dolphin Bay's</b> milk tea isn't A-tier quality, but it was pretty freaking good, combined with their $3 for
          2 Boba Milk Tea special just makes it the king of B-tier. Sadly, they closed or sold the store, so the place is just a 
          relic of the past. But just trust me their drinks were too cheap for its quality. <b>7 Leaves</b> is only B-tier because 
          of their Matcha Soy Tea, otherwise i'd probably put them high C, low-low B. <b>Tiger Sugar's</b> Black Sugar Boba Milk Tea, 
          was good but I think it's too hype. If you want an aesthetic picture of Boba for the gram, then this is the drink. 
          The location was pretty garbage and was hard to find parking; this was pre-covid so idk now. <b>3Catea</b>, the drinks
          were above average, but the place is very cute and aesthetic if you are looking for the gram pics. I went when 
          there were Christmas decorations (also before covid), so i'm not sure how it looks now but the place is modern looking. 
          <b>Ding Tea</b>, I want to rate it higher because I've heard so many good things about them but I just havn't 
          found the drink I love here yet. When I do, maybe it will be A-tier; otherwise all the drinks are decent. 

          <br><br><b> C-tier:</b> 
          <b>Half & Half</b> should honestly probably be mid B-tier, but their cups are just abysmal; they are too big
          and don't fit in cup holders. <b>Class 302</b> also suffers from having too big of a cup, but their boba quality is
          actually just C-tier. <b>Quickly</b> is D-tier boba quality but its so cheap that I bumped it up to C-tier. Basically
          you get what you pay for here. 

          <br><br><b> D-tier:</b> 
          Not much to say about the D-tier. They all are pretty similar in quality and I would probably only come here
          if there was nowhere else to go.

          <br><br><b> F-tier:</b> 
          Don't get me started on <b>Gong Cha</b>, I truly don't understand where all the hype and high-praise for this chain 
          comes from. Not once, have I gotten a drink here and actually really liked it, maybe it was okay, but for the 
          most part it was just bad. And i've been there atleast 10+ times, each time with a new drink and the hope 
          that I would actually like it, but the place just never fails to disappoint me. I also can't describe how weird of an
          after taste I get after drinking/finishing their boba and it's consistent with every drink. Would not recommend going here. 
          <b>Cha2o</b>, I don't really know how to describe them. The last time I ordered here, I got an Almond Milk Tea and it
          was probably the worst boba milk tea drink I have ever had, like ever. It was like if you walked into a Bed, 
          Bath, & Beyond, took every scent in there and mixed it into a drink, and then added cleaning supplies to it. 
          This drink actually gave me a massive headache; I didn't even know this was possible as I only took a small sip of
          the drink and it was like an instant headache. And no, I wasn't dehydrated. Like I said, if you ever walked into a
          candle aisle or Bed, Bath, & Beyond and got a headache from the overwhelming scents, this is what it felt like,
          except in drink form. I also think this was the only Boba Milk Tea drink I have ever straight up threw away after taking 
          a couple sips. Basically, I havn't been here in 3 year and probably will never go again; definitely <b>DO NOT</b>
          recommend. But hey, if its like 1-2 a.m. in the morning and you really want Boba, this will probably be one of, if not
          the only place open. And if you decide to go here, I pray your drink isn't even half as bad as mine.
